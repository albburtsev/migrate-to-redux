# Hello!

It is a bit of real working code to my blog post [How to migrate to Redux in big web applications and survive? (TODO)](#)

If you want to try it, go ahead:

```
git clone git@github.com:albburtsev/migrate-to-redux.git
cd migrate-to-redux/
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000/) in your browser and try to edit source code.

Based on [reaction starter kit](https://github.com/albburtsev/reaction).
